# Face Roulette
A roulette-style selector which takes an image and randomly selects and displays a "winner" from the people in the image.


## Pre-requisites
This program currently requires you to manually [install OpenCV for Python 2.7](http://docs.opencv.org/3.2.0/da/df6/tutorial_py_table_of_contents_setup.html). The most recent tested version was OpenCV 3.2.

## Directions
To run, simply call `python face_roulette.py team_photo_large.jpg` and replace the image with your own.
